## Motivation
Stress in today's society is present in everyone. Whether returning from an exhaustive day working with more to do at home or
for a upcoming exam, many reasons can induce this unpleasant feeling.

We developed a intelligent robot that could help the user in comforting 

## Usage
To initialize the project, run the following commands in an open terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/SenneDeproost/CaCo.git` 
2. `cd CaCo`
3. `bash install.sh`

## Future work
There are several extensions possible to the project. One of them is the integration of user profiles with automatic
which person is interacting with the robot. With this, the robot can learn a global behaviour that can be further 
individualised for a more personal experience.

Another improvement is the usage of the on-board systems of the smartphone instead of using the camera and computational
resources of the computer the application runs on. However, this aks for better access to the device's hardware by integrating
it into a fully functional Android or iOS app or by using a PWA framework. Due to the scope of the project within the course
most of these considerations were left untouched, leaving room for improvement.
